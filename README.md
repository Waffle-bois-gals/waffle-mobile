# Mobile

The Waffle mobile app is a Flutter app that runs on both iOS and Android.

## Getting Started

To spin up the project, run the following commands:

```bash
# go to the flutter project's directory
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Before creating a Pull Request:

```bash
dart format .
dart analyze .
```

if any output is generated by analyzing, resolve those issues, since the Github Action check will not let the PR be merged without them.

Generate translation files with the following:

```bash
 flutter pub run easy_localization:generate --source-dir ./assets/translations -f keys -o locale_keys.g.dart
```

Generate riverpod files, JSON parsing, routes and assets with the following:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
